# Bard College

## College of Skálds 

"And they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing was fair and terrible..."

Warrior-poets whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, Skálds never shy from the front line of battle. Preferring to drive their friends into battle with the rhythm of their war chants, Skálds often abandon their instruments to carry a spear and shield.

### Bonus Proficiencies

When you become a Skáld at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and shields. You also become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, Perception, or Survival.

### Weapon Mastery

At 3rd level, you master a weapon, or family of weapons, as your specialty. Choose one of the options at the end of this document.

Your weapon mastery improves at 6th level.

### Combat Inspiration

Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses. 


### Extra Attack

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.


### Ride to Ruin and the World's End

Starting at 14th level, you can drive your allies to fight with abandon. As a bonus action, you may shout a battle-cry. Choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include yourself) who can hear and understand you. Each creature can decide to attack recklessly on each attack of its turn. Doing so gives them advantage on ability checks using Strength, or melee weapon attack rolls, during this turn, but attack rolls against them have advantage until their next turn. This effect lasts for one minute. A creature cannot be affected by this battle-cry again until it has finished a short or long rest. 

### Battle Magic

Also at 14th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

## Weapon Mastery

### Blade Mastery

You master the shortsword, longsword, scimitar, rapier, and greatsword. You become proficient with these weapons if you are not already, and you gain the following benefits when using any of them:

* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with the weapon.
* On your turn, you can use your reaction to assume a parrying stance, provided you have the weapon in hand. Doing so adds your proficiency bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you’re not holding the weapon.
* When you make an opportunity attack with the weapon, you have advantage on the attack roll.

At 6th level, your bonus to attack rolls made with this weapon becomes +2.


### Fell-Handed

You master the handaxe, battleaxe, and greataxe. You become proficient with these weapons if you are not already, and you gain the following benefits when using any of them:

* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with the weapon.
* Whenever you have advantage on a melee attack roll you make with the weapon and hit, you can knock the target prone if the lower of the two d20 rolls would also hit the target.
* Whenever you have disadvantage on a melee attack roll you make with the weapon, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 0) if the attack misses but the higher of the two d20 rolls would have hit.
* If a creature moves 5 feet or more while within your reach, you may use your reaction to attempt to knock the creature prone by attacking with your axe handle. If you hit with the attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. If the target is knocked prone, its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its current turn. 

At 6th level, on your turn, when you score a critical hit with an axe or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.


```
```

### Spear Mastery

Though the spear is a simple weapon to learn, it rewards you for the time you have taken to master it. You become proficient with the spear if you are not already, and you gain the following benefits.

* You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with a spear.
* When you use a spear, its damage die changes from a d6 to a d8, and from a d8 to a d10 when wielded with two hands. (This benefit has no effect if another feature has already improved the weapon’s die.)
* When a creature enters your spear’s reach, you can make a melee attack against it with your spear as a reaction. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 piercing damage, or an extra 1d10 piercing damage if you wield the spear with two hands.
* As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your reach with a spear by 5 feet until the beginning of your next turn.

At 6th level, your melee attack range with your spear is increased to 10 feet.
